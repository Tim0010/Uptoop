## 💡 Pro Tips

1. Open in Canva or any image editor
2. Add a white (or colored) background layer
3. Place logo on top
4. Export as PNG with no transparency

### If Logo is Too Small
If the logo appears too small in the 512x512 canvas:

1. Open in Canva
2. Create 512x512 canvas
3. Upload logo
4. Scale up to fill ~80% of canvas
5. Keep some padding around edges
6. Export

### If Logo Quality is Low
If resizing makes the logo blurry:

1. Try to find a higher resolution version of the logo
2. Or use vector version (SVG/AI) if available
3. Export at 512x512 from vector source
4. Use "Export for screens" at 2x or 3x then scale down
